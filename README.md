## About

This repository is intended to show my interpretations of web mockups from dribbble.com. All credits are given where due.

This repository is also meant to help beginning and intermediate front-end developers grasp the concepts of front-end web development.

I work alone and I'm unemployed at the moment, so this repository doubles as my portfolio. If you find this repository helpful please consider giving it a star so that others can find it more easily. Thanks.

This is a work in progress, so please keep checking back.
